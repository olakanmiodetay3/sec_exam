The counter App which is the key project, has few buttons which performs the functionalities.

one of the buttons is the increment which is used to increase the value
another is the decrement button which is used to decrease the value
we have the reset button used to bring the value back to the initial value
there is also the SetValue Button used to set the value of choice without the need to use the increment and decrement button

## How the Error Boundary works
Error boundary is implementted in order to catch JavaScript error anywhere in there child component tree, and display a fall-back UI instead of the component tree that crashed. it can be tested as it found on the Home Page.

## how the 404 works. 

it is just a way of telling the user that an error has occured if a wrong url is inputed.
